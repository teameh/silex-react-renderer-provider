# Silex React Renderer Service Provider 

# ReactBundle

ReactBundle integrates [ReactRenderer](https://github.com/Limenius/ReactRenderer) in your Silex project. This lets you implement React.js client and server-side rendering, allowing the development of universal (isomorphic) applications.

This project is a Silex adaption of [Nacho Mart√≠n's](https://github.com/nacmartin) great [ReactBundle](https://github.com/Limenius/ReactBundle).

Both ReactBundle and this provider build on top of [React On Rails](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails), and uses [`react-on-rails`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-on-rails) to render React components. Don't worry you don't need and won't see any Ruby when using this package.
